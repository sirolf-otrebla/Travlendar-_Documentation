\section{Scope}

\emph{Travlendar+} is aimed to be a 360 degree scheduler of everyone daily life .
Firstly, the user will be able to define his appointments (time(flexible or not), location, type) and a wide range of preferences. Preferences will include: type of transport(walk, bike, car, public transport), travel means( max dist by walk, bus not after late, etc..), minimize carbon footprint(eco-friendly). 
The system will be able to schedule the user appointments taking into account its preferences and making sure it will no be late. In addition, it will propose various mobility options considering time constraints(speed, traffic...), weather constraints(rain->no bike), type of appointment(work meetings-> no bike, morning->bike better then car... ), day constraints(strikes, festivity...), price constraints. 
Finally, the system will permit the user to buy public tickets or rent/locate the nearest car/bike considering: potential discount, daily/weekly/season pass.
Today doesn't exist a system that integrates all these features, so it is the first time that this application is entering the market, and this allow us to develop all the system from scratch
