\section{Software System Attributes}
In this Section we detail the attributes that our System must guarantee to be robust, scalable and secure.

\subsection{Reliability} 
The system will have to be designed in order to be robust and fault tolerant. In particular, the system will have to manage either software or hardware modules failures without losing information.

\subsection{Availability}
The System must be available 24/7, exception made for maintenance interventions (both exceptional and routine ones).

\subsection{Security}
The System must guarantee a secure connection between Client and Server through the HTTPS protocol. 
Secondly, the System must properly handle and store the users data through a \textcolor{red}{recognized standard for databases encryption.} 

\subsection{Maintainability}
The System must provide a detailed documentation for each software module
\textcolor{blue}{System must be developed to be expandable.}

\subsection{Portability}

The software has to be able to work under different versions of the chosen work environment, either at back end level and front end level.
