\section{Scope}

\emph{Travlendar+} is aimed to be a 360 degree agenda for everyone's daily life.
Firstly, the user will be able to define his appointments and a wide range of preferences. Preferences will include: type of transport, kind of appointment, eco-friendly profile.

The system will be able to schedule the user appointments taking into account his preferences and making sure it will not be late. In addition, it will propose various mobility options considering time constraints(speed, traffic...), weather constraints(e.g. when it rains the user would avoid bikes trip), day constraints(strikes, festivity...). 

Finally, the system will permit the user to buy public tickets, rent or locate the nearest car or bike. This will be done considering potential discount and daily, weekly or season travel card.

Nowadays a system that integrates all these features doesn't exist, neither a supporting framework, this allow us to design the entire system from scratch.
