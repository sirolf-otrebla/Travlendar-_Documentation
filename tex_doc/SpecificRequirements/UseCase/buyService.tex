\subsection{Buying a vehicle-sharing or a public transport service}
The user, for some tasks, maybe wants to take a bus or another public transport service. Furthermore, in Milan there are lots of alternatives to public transport, such as the car-sharing or the bike-sharing services, so the user might want to use one of these to reach a task location. For this reason, the \emph{Travlendar+} System, not only support the user in the process of choosing and buying a possible rides from the public transport site or application, but also redirects the user to the right place where to book and rent a shared based travel mean service.
