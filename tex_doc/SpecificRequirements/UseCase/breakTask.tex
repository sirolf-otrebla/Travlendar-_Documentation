\subsection{Adding a break time}
In the \emph{Travlendar+} application if the user wants to have some free time he can create a break time. For instance, if the user wants to have lunch at 1 p.m. he can add to his calendar a break time task. This particular kind of task is scheduled according to the user's preferences as a normal task, with flexible time and periodicity but, without a specific location: we suppose that the user will have a break close to where he is.
In addition, if the break time is scheduled close to lunch time, then the \emph{Travlendar+} System will suggest the user a place where to eat.
