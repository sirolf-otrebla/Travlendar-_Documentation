The IOS version of the application will be designed to run under Apple IOS operating system, version 9.3.5 or later.
Moreover, both the Android and the IOS version of \emph{Travlendar+} requires an available Internet connection.

The \emph{Travlendar+} application can be executed also on a web browser through a web interface of the software. In order to run \emph{Travlendar+} on a browser, it has to support \emph{HTML5}, \emph{CSS3} and \emph{Javascript}.

Finally the \emph{Backend} system will have to run under modern UNIX systems, for example GNU/Linux systems or GNU/BSD systems. Indeed its easier to find people who can maintain a GNU based system.
