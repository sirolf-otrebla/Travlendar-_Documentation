\subsection{Show Transport Information about a Task}

If the user wants more information about what kind of vehicles he needs to take to reach others tasks location, he can select a task from the calendar page and automatically more information about that task will be shown. For example, the trip indications and the travel means involved: if he needs to take a bus, a share-based vehicle or his own vehicle. Notice that, if the user take his own private vehicle, the application will schedule the day travels in such a way that allows the user to retake his own vehicle.
