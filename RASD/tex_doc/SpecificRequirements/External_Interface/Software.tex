\subsection{Software Interfaces}
The \emph{Travlendar+} system needs to know more information concerning, for instance, the traffic on the roads, the weather forecast or the status of the public transport service.
So, in order to schedule the user's calendar, our application needs to interact with these external software:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item External Map Service
    \item External Weather Service
    \item Public Transport System
    \item Car-Sharing Service
    \item Bike-Sharing Service
\end{enumerate}
All these software will be accessed through specific \emph{APIs}
