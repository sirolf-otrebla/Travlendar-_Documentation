\chapter{Formal Analysis}
    
    Here we present a possible formal model regarding the \emph{Travlendar+} functionalities and context. This model has been written using Alloy, which is a bounded first logic prover that allows us to formalize a specific description of each entity used by the Software.
    
    \section{Signatures and Facts}
        Here we present all signatures composing our alloy model. We chose to include facts between signatures because it results much more simple to understand about what signature each FOL formula refers to, and so about what constraints each signature have. For this reason, we decided to comment each separate constraint, in order to gain readability compared to either uncommented code or separate fact modeling.
