The \emph{Travlendar+} Software has the main goal to schedule all the user's day in the best way. Furthermore, the application has to give the best travel solution to allow the user to reach his appointments in time.
To do that, the user has to give his tasks to our system, and then the system creates a possible calendar, considering user's preferences, tasks' priorities and roads status.
