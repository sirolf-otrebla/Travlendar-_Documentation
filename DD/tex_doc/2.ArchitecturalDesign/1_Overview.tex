\section{Overview}
\emph{Travlendar+} is an application that schedules the user's appointments, taking into account various tasks types, traffic information and similar constraints. To do that as well as possible, the system is composed by four tiers, which are: the client tier, the web server tier, the application server tier and the data tier.

\emph{Travlendar+} uses these four tier to guarantee the best flexibility of the application, indeed the user can access to his calendar through either the web or the mobile application. Moreover, these four tiers permit to have a system that is easily maintained by developers.

The application is divided into seven main components: the \emph{web client} and the \emph{mobile application client}, the \emph{Application Façade}, the \emph{Presenter}, the \emph{Business Logic} and finally the \emph{Data Layer}.

When a client wants to connect to the application, through, a web page or a mobile application interface, sends an https request, according to the REST protocol. This request is received by the \emph{Travlendar+} web server, that contains the \emph{Application Façade} component. The web server is used in order to create a secure zone for the application server, in this way the security of the system can be improved. The web server takes the HTTPS request, translate it in a socket request and then send it to the application server, through the \emph{Presenter} component. This component is used to call the correct functionalities of the \emph{Business Logic}, that is the core of the entire system. This layer is used to add a new user to the system, to control the login system, to create a calendar, to add/modify/delete a task and to compute a travel. The \emph{Business Logic} component indeed does the required operations on the user data, then interacts with the \emph{Data Layer} component to store these information or to receive some information either from the internal database or from an external service. For this reason the \emph{Data Layer} component is used to interact with both the internal DBMS and the external APIs services.

Finally, once the user's request is satisfied, the \emph{Business Logic} sends the useful data to the \emph{Application Façade} component through the internal socket connection, provided by the \emph{Presenter} interface, and then the data are translated into a JSON file, and this is sent to the client.
